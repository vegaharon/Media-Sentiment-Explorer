 # Data Source
Global Database of Events, Language, and Tone (GDELT)

GDELT is a very rich and informtive dataset with a huge potential that is described as: 
> "an initiative to construct a catalog of human societal-scale behavior and beliefs across all countries of the world, connecting every person, organization, location, count, theme, news source, and event across the planet into a single massive network that captures what's happening around the world, what its context is and who's involved, and how the world is feeling about it, every single day."

# GDELT:
  - Monitors the world's broadcast, print, and web news from nearly every corner of every country in over 100 languages
  - Identifies the people, locations, organizations, themes, sources, emotions, counts, quotes, images and events driving our global society every second of every day
  - Provides four sentiment attributes for each publication: Average tone, Number of positive words,  Number of negative words, and Polarity.
